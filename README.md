# os_gather
The best way to gather new oursponsors data. Why?
* It's designed to be a microservice that is independent of our main REST APIs
* It is fully Async leveraging Java Concurrency
* Server Client issuefixes and workarounds. Yes, when we find a limitation on the server,
there will be more attention given to optimization, performance, better thought out
solutions instead of the "quick fix" or "workaround" that just gets the job done.
